This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. This dataset encompasses lattice-physics parameters—the infinite multiplication factor (k-inf) and the pin power peaking factor (PPPF)—modeled as functions of variations in fuel pin enrichments for the NuScale US600 fuel assembly type C-01 (NFAC-01) [NuScale FSAR]. These critical parameters were computed using the MCNP6 code, a Monte Carlo-based tool for nuclear reactor criticality simulations. Fuel pin enrichments were uniformly sampled within the range of 0.7–5.0 weight percent (w/o) U-235 to generate the dataset. The dataset contains 39 features, each representing the enrichment of a specific fuel rod in a one-eighth symmetry of the NFAC assembly. The outputs of interest are the k-inf and PPPF values associated with these enrichments.
